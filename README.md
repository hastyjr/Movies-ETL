# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this analytis was to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database in order to have a clean dataset to use. In doing this, I followed the ETL process: `extract` the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, `transform` the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and `load` the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
